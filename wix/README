MRBS provides an authentication type that allows the authentication of users
against Wix websites.  To install and configure this, you need to make changes
on both the Wix and MRBS servers.

On the Wix site
===============

1. Create a http-functions.js file in your Wix backend (see the Wix YouTube
video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yCBplV3MPQ for how to do it) and copy
and paste the contents of the file wix/web/http-functions.js into it.  You will
need to open the file with a suitable text editor such as Notepad++.  If you
already have a http-functions.js file you will need to merge the contents with
your existing file.

2. Publish the file by clicking the "Publish" button.

3. In the Wix Secrets Manager (found under Developer Tools in your Wix
dashboard) create a new secret called "MRBS_API_key".  (You can choose your own
name, but if so you will need to change the MRBS configuration - see below.)
Generate an API key (search the web for "API key generator" or "GUID generator".
Copy and paste this key into the secret and store it.

4. In your Wix dashboard, go to Contacts then Site Members.  Under More Actions
click Manage Member Info.  Add a custom field of type "Number" called "MRBS
Admin" and use this to assign a non-zero value to those members that you want
to be admins for MRBS.  (You can call the field something else, in which case
you should change the relevant MRBS config setting - see below.)


On the MRBS site
================

Set the following configuration variables in your config.inc.php file:

$auth['type'] = "wix";

// The URL of your WIX site
$auth['wix']['site_url'] = "https://example.com/";

// The API key that you generated and saved in your Wix secrets manager.
$auth['wix']['mrbs_api_key'] = "";

// The name of the secret in your Wix secrets manager
$auth['wix']['mrbs_api_key_secret_name'] = "MRBS_API_key";

// The name of the custom field that determines whether a member is an
// MRBS admin.  The field name should be entered in lower case below and
// spaces converted to "-" symbols.  Note that you can also configure admins
// in the config file by using
// $auth['admin'][] = "someone@example.com";
$auth['wix']['admin_property'] = "custom.mrbs-admin";
